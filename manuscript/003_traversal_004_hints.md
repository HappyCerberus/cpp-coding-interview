## Hints

### Locked rooms

1. Think about the keys.
2. The question we need to answer is whether we can collect all keys.
3. We do not need to find the shortest route; therefore, a depth-first search will be good enough.

### Sudoku solver

1. We have walked through the solution for a very similar problem.
2. Try modifying the solution for N-Queens.
3. What constraints can we propagate to improve the solving performance?
