# Introduction

Welcome, you are reading the Surviving the C++ coding interview book. I conceived this book's idea during the mass layoffs of 2022/2023.

Companies still insist on using coding puzzles during interviews, so training for this part of the interview process remains necessary.

This book aims to guide you through the different types of problems you can come across while also focusing on information that will be relevant past the interview process.

After finishing this book, you should be able to recognize the solution patterns when presented with a problem and transform those patterns into an implementation.

As with all my books, this book focuses on practical information. The text is interspersed with commented examples, and the book comes with a companion repository that contains a comprehensive test suite. You are encouraged to attempt to solve each of the presented problems yourself and only then compare it with the commented solution.
