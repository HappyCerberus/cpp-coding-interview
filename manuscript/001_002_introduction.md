# Introduction

## Book structure

Training will be a critical part of the learning process unless you possess the gift of eidetic memory. This book is designed to both guide and help you during the training process.

Each chapter of the book follows the same structure:

- introduction with any relevant C++-specific background
- base patterns and simple operations
- hand-picked problems with commented solutions

The chapters follow a relatively sequential structure, building upon each other. However, that doesn't mean you must read the chapters in a sequence. The book provides a complete index; when you run into a concept or algorithm you are unfamiliar with, check the index.

## Training

The book comes with a companion repository that contains a test suite and scaffolding for each of the problems. The repository is also configured with a DevContainer. You will get a fully working C++ development environment with the latest stable GCC, GDB and Clang if you open the repository in VS Code. The only prerequisites are Visual Studio Code and Docker.

Practice is crucial, so always try to solve the presented problems yourself before you read the solutions. Even if you do not know how to approach the problem with the requested complexity, at least try to solve the problem using brute force.

Once you have the brute-force solution working, consider how you could optimize it. For example, what work are you duplicating, and how can you eliminate it? This iterative process is crucial when the path toward an optimal solution isn't clear.
