# Introduction

## Book structure

Unless you're blessed with a photographic memory, training will be essential to your learning journey. This book is specifically designed to facilitate and enrich this process for you.

Each chapter adheres to a consistent structure to ensure a steady progression. We start with an introduction that covers relevant C++ background as necessary. Then, we move on to basic patterns and simple operations. Each chapter concludes with carefully selected problems, complemented by solutions and commentary.

While the chapters are sequential, with each building on the foundations of the previous, the book doesn't restrict you to strict reading order. Instead, it comes with a comprehensive index. You can always refer to the index to lookup more details if you encounter an unfamiliar concept or algorithm.

## Training

This book is complemented by a repository that provides a test suite and scaffolding for each problem. The repository is set up with a DevContainer. It allows for a seamless C++ development environment, equipped with the latest stable versions of GCC, GDB, and Clang when accessed through VS Code. All you need to take full advantage of this are Visual Studio Code and Docker.

The process you employ to solve the problems presented in this book is essential. Typically, in a coding interview, you vocalize your thoughts to allow for feedback and guidance. However, while using this book, that instant interaction isn't available. Should you find yourself stuck, consider this strategy:

First, ensure you grasp the problem at hand. Then, try sketching it out or examining some examples on paper.

Next, see if you can implement a simple brute-force solution as a starting point. From there, ask yourself what could be optimized. Is there repeated work? Can one solution inform another?

If you're genuinely stumped, the hints section could offer valuable insight. It begins by outlining the tools or approaches that might be useful and then provides more detailed suggestions.
