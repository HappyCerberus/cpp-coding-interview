# Preface

Welcome, you are reading the Surviving the C++ coding interview book. I conceived this book's idea during the mass layoffs of 2022/2023.

Most companies still insist on using coding puzzles during interviews, and while for some, this is only a convenient scaffolding, for many, it remains the primary filter for candidates. Therefore training for this part of the interview remains a necessity.

This book aims to guide you through the different types of problems you can come across while also focusing on information that will remain relevant past the interview process.

After finishing this book, you should be able to recognize the solution patterns when presented with a problem and transform those patterns into an implementation.

As with all my books, this book focuses on practical information. The text is interspersed with commented examples, and the book comes with a companion repository that contains a comprehensive test suite. You are encouraged to attempt to solve each of the presented problems yourself and only then compare it with the commented solution.

## The commercial edition vs. community edition

This book is part of my Creative Common series (under the CC-BY-NC-SA  4.0 license), and as such, the commercial edition doesn't differ from the community edition.

On top of that, 100% of my royalties from the purchases of this book go to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

## The author

I am Šimon Tóth, the sole author of this book. My primary qualification is 20 years of C++ experience, with C++ being my primary language in a commercial setting for approximately 15 of those years.

My background is in HPC, spanning academia, big tech, and startup environments.

I have architected, built, and operated systems of all scales, from single-machine hardware-supported high-availability to planet-scale services.

My passion has always been teaching and mentoring junior engineers throughout my career, which is why you are now reading this book.
