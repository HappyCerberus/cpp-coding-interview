## Reverse k-groups in a list

There isnâ€™t anything algorithmically complex in this problem. However, there are many opportunities to trip up and make a mistake.

We talked about reversing a singly-linked list in the simple operations section. This operation will be our base for reversing the group of k elements.

```cpp
List::Node* reverse(List::Node *head, int64_t k) {
    List::Node *result = nullptr;
    List::Node *iter = head;

    for (int64_t i = 0; i < k; ++i)
        iter = std::exchange(iter->next, std::exchange(result, iter));
        /* we want to put iter to the front of the list
            but we want the original value of result to be the new iter->next
            but we want the original value of iter->next to be the new iter
        */

    return result;
}
```

The complexity lies in applying this operation multiple times in sequence. For that, we need to keep track of terminating nodes:

- the head of the already processed part; this will be our final result
- the tail of the already processed part; this is where we will attach each reversed section as we iterate
- the head of the unprocessed part; both for iteration and to link the tail of the processed part

```cpp
void reverse_groups(List &list, int64_t k) {
    List::Node *unprocessed_head = list.head;
    List::Node *processed_tail = nullptr;
    List::Node *result = nullptr;
    List::Node *iter = list.head;

    while (iter != nullptr) {
        // advanced by k elements
        int cnt = 0;
        iter = unprocessed_head;
        while (cnt < k && iter != nullptr) {
            iter = iter->next;
            ++cnt;
        }

        // if we have a full set of k elements
        if (cnt == k) {
            List::Node *processed_head = reverse(unprocessed_head, k);
            // initialize the result if this is the first group
            if (result == nullptr)
                result = processed_head;
            // if this isn't the first group, link the existing tail
            if (processed_tail != nullptr)
                processed_tail->next = processed_head;

            // what was head is now the tail of the reversed section
            processed_tail = unprocessed_head;
            // and iter is the new head
            unprocessed_head = iter;
        }
    }
    if (processed_tail != nullptr)
        processed_tail->next = unprocessed_head;
    list.head = result == nullptr ? unprocessed_head : result;
}
```
